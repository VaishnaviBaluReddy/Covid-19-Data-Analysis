This study presents the current situation of coronavirus spread in India. In the wake of the Coronavirus  outbreak, many data sources have been made available to the public in an effort to encourage research in the field.The goal is to apply recent advances in machine learning and natural language processing to generate insights into the infectious  disease.As is true of most text mining efforts, generating summary statistics and visually representing the content of text information is a very important part of exploratory data analysis.In this project, we will perform exploratory data analysis on the COVID-19 cases in India. We will use python libraries such as ‘seaborn’, ‘matplotlib’ ,'Folium'and Pandas to explore and visualize the  categorical and text information provided in the data set.
